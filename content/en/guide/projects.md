Inside a workspace the most important concept are Projects. Projects are a collection of API modules, documentation and other artifacts you want to keep together.

## What is a Project

A project in ApiGear is used to group API Modules inside your workspace. A project typically contains a set of API modules to describe the different aspects of your API. A project can be public or private. If a project is private it is only visible and editable by workspace members. If a project is public it is visible by everyone but can only be edited by your workspace members. Additional to API Modules a project can contain markdown documents and other artifacts to enhance the documentation experience.

## Create a new project

- Open [ApiGear](https://app.apigear.io) and login.
- Select the workspace you want to add the project to
- Inside the workspace click ***Create Project*** and fill in the project form.
- A project name should be short and precise to cover the project intention.
- Decide carefull if the project shall be public or private. 
- The project url will be `https://app.apigear/<workspace>/<project>/`.
- You will be automatically directed to the new project.
- Now you can start creating API modules, markdown documents and other artifacts to the project.
- You can change the name, project visibility and other options in the project settings.

Next add an [API Module](modules) to your newly create project.
