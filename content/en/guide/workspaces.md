ApiGear enables software construction using an API driven process in a collaborative manner. This enables you to drive efficiency, consistency and discipline across your API driven teams.

## What is a Workspace

A workspace in ApiGear is used to group API Projects across your team to promote visibility, standards and reuse. Typically there exists on workspace for your whole organisation but you can also create several workspaces based on your team structure or functions.

A default workspace is already created for you when you register. This is your personal workspace for your personal API Projects. You can also use it for your organisation or you can create an own dedicated workspace for your organisation.

To create a new workspace:

- Open [ApiGear](https://app.apigear.io) and login.
- On your dashboard click on "Create Team" and fill in the team site form.
- Ideally the name of your workspace should be your organization name. The resulting url will be `app.apigear.io/<workspace>/`
- You will be automatically directed to the new workspace.
- By default your are the new owner of the new workspace and can invite new members.
- You can change the members, name, owner and other options in the workspace settings.

Next add [projects](project) to your newly create workspace.
