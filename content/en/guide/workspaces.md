ApiGear enables software construction using an API driven process in a collaborative manner. This enables you to drive efficiency, consistency and discipline across your API driven teams.

## What is a Workspace

A workspace in ApiGear is used to group API Projects across your organisation to promote visibility, standards and reuse. We at ApiGear recommend to create one workspace for your whole organisation but you can also create several workspaces based on your team structure or functions.

A default workspace is already created for you when you register. This is your personal workspace for your personal API Projects. You can also use it for your organisation or you can create an own workspace.

To create a new workspace:

- Open [ApiGear](https://app.apigear.io) and login.
- On your dashboard click on "Create Workspace" and fill in the workspace form.
- Ideally the name of your workspace should be your organization name. The resulting url will be `app.apigear.io/<workspace>/`
- You will be automatically directed to the new workspace.
- By default your are the new owner of the new workspace.
- You can change the owner and other options in the workspace settings.

Next add [projects](project) to your newly create workspace.
