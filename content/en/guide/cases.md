ApiGear provides a modern an API driven workflow using ObjectAPI to construct software. An API led process provides many benefits to many stakeholders. Here are some use cases listed.


- **Design**: Create clean object APIs, consistently across the teams
- **Blueprints**: Develop API driven software efficiently using our SDK blueprints and simulations
- **Documentation**: Create an interactive developer experience for internal and external stakeholders
- **Collaboration**: Gather your team around APIs and the all stakeholders can participate
- **Governance**: Establish a governance to foster reuse, consistency and quality across your teams.
- **Visibility**: Provide visibility into the life software status by tracking API status
- **Analytics**: Make data driven decisions based on API traffic analytics
