Each ApiGear project belongs to a team, even if it's a team of one.

## Transfer projects between teams

You can transfer any project for which you have Owner access to any team where you are an Owner or Collaborator. To do this, go to the project's settings page, under `Settings > General > Project information` and select `Transfer project`. You may choose to create a new team from the dropdown.

::: warning
Transferring a project between teams may affect project members, features, or pricing. This varies depending on the current project settings and the plans of the teams you're transferring between, so be sure to read the in-app warnings carefully.
:::

Here are some general rules to keep in mind:

- Project members who are not members of the destination team will lose access to the project. You may want to invite them to the team before transferring.
- Some features and settings are restricted to specific plans. If the destination team is on a lower plan than the originating team, you will lose andy settings you may have entered for the features you lose. Check the current plan for each team and compare their features and pricing.

To transfer projects between teams with no shared Owners or Collaborators, place contact support.
