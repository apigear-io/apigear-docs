The C++ 14 code SDK generates a C++ 14 conform interfaces to be implemented by the developers. If scaffolding is switched on it will also generate a full project with CMake and test support. The project will scale with new API modules.

Following blueprint feature switches are supported:

* Basic - Only creates the interface files for you
* Scaffold - Creates a full project with reference implementation and build system support.


In the generated source code you will find a `README` which explain in great detail how to build and use the code.
