ApiGear is a team based collaborative tool which provides a new and unique ObjectAPI driven digital workflow for software construction with integrated API analytics.

We enable teams to develop software driven products without friction using by providing a workflow around machine readable APIs and enhanced device analytics.

[ObjectAPI Specification by ApiGear](https://objectapi.org) is a new interface language similar to OpenAPI but models Objects and their communication as a machine readable API specification. ObjectAPI is influenced by real world object communication covered in different programming languages and small and large scale software projects.
