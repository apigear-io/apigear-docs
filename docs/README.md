# About ApiGear

ApiGear is an online software workflow platform based on an API driven process. At the beginning you create your project using one of the many project templates. A project comes with an SDK which is generated for you on the fly. You can extend the SDK using APIs defined using the ObjectAPI specification. The SDK comes with many production ready features, designed by the community and our experts.

As a platform we try to guide you through your product lifecycle from requirements engineering, technology choices, API design. We have ready to be used tools for simulation and scenarios. Also when your device has beend sold we can support you by capturing device usage data using our API Analytics solution.

With ApiGear, you can:

- Create your Project SDK
- Define APIs to extend your project
- Simulate data and behavior from other SW components and hardware
- Host all your developer documentation in one place
- Capture an d analyze data from device during development
- Use our API analytics solution to capture device usage from devices deployed in the field
- Generate client and library SDKs for different programming languages and technologies
- Share your APIs publicly and privately
- Iterate the API design and manage multiple API versions.

If you own a professional account you can also:

- Create your own project templates
- Register you own code generators
- Get richer data analytocs features for your marketing team
- Get an overview of the current status of API implementations

## Get Started

To get started ti is best to follow one of our guides.

- Setting up your account
- Create your first project
- Create your first API
- Generate and use an SDK
- Simulate static data from your API
- Create scenarios for advanced simulations
- Trace your API calls while you run your project
- Register your device with ApiGear
- Trace your device usage with ApiGear

## Exploring APIs

You can browse the community created APIs and explore the public projects from our users. To create own SW projects you need to register first and sign in into ApiGear.

As a new user you are greeting with a new team with you as the owner and the sole member. In the free version you can only create public projects and one private project and use only our open source SDK generators. These are ideal if you plan to create an open source project.

If you plan to create a commercial project you should consider to sign-up to our professional account, which comes with a 14 days trial version, and the generated code will come with a license of your choosing. In the professional version you can also add more members to your team.

To get started you need to create a new project and start creating your first API. ApiGear is an API driven workflow, so we center around the use of APIs to extend you project functionality.

If you want you can already create your first SDK. Go over to the SDK tab and select a SDK generator of your choosing. Press run and then wait a moment. You will be directed to the download page to download your fresh new SDK. When you down
