# Manage team members

Collaborators can be given access to all projects within a team, or only by specific projects.

## Manage members

### Add new team members

If you're a team owner, you can invite new team members to the team by selecting `Add members` button in the upper right.

The first step to add someone to your team is to enter their email address. You can enter several email addresses separated by commas to invite multiple people at once. Then select `Continue`.

Depending on your team [plan](https://apigear.io/pricing), you may need to purchase additional seats to add new members. If this is the case, we will inform you of the costs before you continue.

In the next step, select the permissions for these new team members. After selecting the role (and project access if applicable) for the new team members, the invites will be ready to send.

### Change a team member's permissions

If you're a team owner, you can change a team member's permissions via the `Team members` list. To change someone's role (and project access if applicable), select `Options -> Edit member`. To remove a team member, select `Options -> Remove from team`.

Note that every team must have a least one Owner. As an Owner, you cannot remove yourself or denote yourself unless there is an additional Owner on the team.

### Manage project members

Owners can allow Collaborators to work on all projects within the team, or only on specific projects. The team list will indicate whether a team member has access to all projects or only specific projects. Owners have access to all projects.

To find out which members can access a particular project, go to Projects, select the project, and visit "Settings > General > Project members"

Owners can change what project a Collaborator is able to access. This is done from the Team members list which can be reached via a link at the bottom of the Project members section or by selection the team from the Dashboard page and then selecting the members tab. On the Team members list, Owners can select "Options > Edit member" to change member's permissions.
