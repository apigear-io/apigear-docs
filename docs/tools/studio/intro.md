# Introduction

The desktop studio is a desktop application that allows you to create and manage APIs. It is available for Linux, MacOS and Windows.

It allows users to work with APIs, SDKs and API traffic in a single application. It also provides a set of tools to help you create and manage APIs.

## Installation

The desktop studio is available for Linux, MacOS and Windows. It can be installed from the [release page](https://github.com/apigear-io/studio/releases).

## Update

The desktop studio will automatically check for updates and prompt you to update when a new version is available. The update will be downloaded in the background and installed when you restart the application.

The update is checked once per application start.

:::tip

- There are currently no certificates for the update server. This means that you will get a warning when you start the application for the first time.
- There is currently no support for manually check for updates. This feature will be added in the future.
