# Guide

ApiGear is a team based, collaborative workflow platform for API driven software development. At the core of ApiGear is the ObjectAPI definition. This allows you to define your software interfaces using interface schema. Your interface description can then be transformed into source code using one of our SDK generators. At any time you can extend or modify your APIs and create a new updated SDK or just the interfaces.

From the API definition you can create an API portal, create code SDKs, create simulation data or monitor your API instances.

As a platform we try to guide you through your product lifecycle from requirements engineering, technology choices, API design and deployment. Also when your software has been deployed we can support you by capturing interface usage data using our API Analytics solution.
