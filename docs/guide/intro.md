# Introduction

APIGear is an API contract workflow solution. It allows users to define APIs as contracts between entities and use these contracts at different stages in the daily work from early sketching of APIs, to integrate code into your product and analyse deployed APIs.

From management perspective an API contract is a business document to specify a set of deliverables. From a developer perspective an API contract a technical document which defines an agreement between two technical parties to work towards a common goal.

We will see the differentiation between management and development several times, throughout the documentation.

## How it works

API contracts are split into modules. Each module represent a partial agreement and can be versioned independent form the rest of the contract. A contract can be documented directly inside the definition but also in external documents called pages. Typically a page describes additional concepts or underlying information to the recipient.

- **Bundling**: Modules are bundled inside a project and can be exported as in different document formats or presented online to share the current API contract state across the team.

- **Transformation**: For developers API contracts can be transformed into source code and updated regularly as SDKs. The source code can either be minimal to allow an integration into an existing offering or comes with a ready-to-use project structure to jump-start the development.
