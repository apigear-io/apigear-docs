# Invite Members

Design, create, document, test and governance are essential tasks belonging to a API driven managed project. To create a great API it requires all information from all stakeholders coming together using the same platform and same modern tooling. Knowledge silos will lead to inconsistency and friction.

ApiGear was developed with a modern API workflow in mind. It gives your team the tools to work on a single platform and ensures that every stakeholder has the most up-to-date information and modern tools they need to do their job effectively.
