# API Monitor

ApiGear Blueprints can support the API monitoring protocol. It allows clients to send API usage information to an API Monitoring Service.

For development a server is embedded into your local ApiGear Studio application. This allows developers to see in real-time how the API is used and detect any anomalies fast.

_Note: If your Blueprint supports tracing, please consult the individual blueprint documentation._
