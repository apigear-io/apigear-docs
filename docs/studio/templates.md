# API Templates

The API Templates view shows you all the API templates in the project or available from the cloud. You can install, update or remove the templates.

These templates are listed at the ApiGEar template server and can be used to generate the source code for your API modules.

To install your local custom templates, click the `Local Template` button and select the template package to be installed.

The installed packages are then available for your solutions to be used.

The currently available templates are listed in the [SDK Templates](/sdks) section.

If you are interested to create your own template or extend an existing template, please read the [template guide](/maker).
