# API Simulations

The API Simulation View shows you all the API simulation documents in the project. You can edit and delete the documents. You can also run the simulation, which will run a simulation server loaded with the selected simulation.

Now you can target your client API towards the simulation server and use the API to test the simulation, without a service backend required.

The simulation document format is described in the [simulation guide](/simulation).
