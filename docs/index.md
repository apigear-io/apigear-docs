ApiGear is a team based collaborative tool which provides a new and unique digital workflow for software construction with integrated API analytics.

We enable teams to develop software driven products without friction by providing a [workflow](tutorials/devcycle) around machine readable APIs and enhanced device analytics.

[ObjectAPI Specification by ApiGear](../objectapi/overview) is a new interface language similar to OpenAPI but models objects and their communication as a machine readable API specification. ObjectAPI is influenced by real world object communication inspired by different programming languages, small and large scale software projects.
