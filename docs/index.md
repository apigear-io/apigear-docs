# About ApiGear

ApiGear is a collaborative platform where you can define your APIs using the ObjectAPI Specification, and manage your APIs throughout their lifecycle. ApiGear is brought to you by the same people behind the ObjectAPI specification and the open-source ObjectAPI tools. It integrates the core tools into a single platform to help you coordinate the entire workflow of an API's lifecycle.

With ApiGear, you can:

- Define you APIs in the ObjectAPI format.
- Host all your API definitions in a single place.
- Store your common API modules in domains and reference them.
- Collaborate on API definitions using teams
- Generate client and library SDKs
- Share your APIs publicly and privately
- Iterate the API design and manage multiple API versions.
