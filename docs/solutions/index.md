# API Solutions

The API solution document captures the configuration of API modules and the technology templates used to generate the source code. You can see it as a recipe for creating a larger single or multi layered SDK.

The solution consist of a set of layers. Each layer is a combination of API modules with a technology template and an output folder.

When a solution runs it generates for each layer a SDK. This is very helpful in case you want to create a solution based on the same API for multiple targets and languages.
